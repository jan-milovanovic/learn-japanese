# learn-japanese
Flutter application developed to help you learn Japanese language more efficiently

<br>

Application is currently **private**.
<br>
Data was scraped using **Dart (http, convert, path provider)** and **Python (sellenium, urllib)**.
<br>
I am not planning on publishing until I correct a couple of issues / add desired functionality and get content creator approvals.

<br>

Application content obtained from:
* [kanjialive](https://app.kanjialive.com/search)
* [learnjapanesedaily](https://learnjapanesedaily.com/most-common-japanese-words.html)

<br>

Future plans:
* Add video playback to desktop machines
* Fix video to seek instantly upon load
* Add searchbar
* Add credit and links to original content creators
* REDO next and previous button or swipe kanji radicals
* Tutorial upon first app launch
